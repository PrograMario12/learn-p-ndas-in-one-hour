## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and pandas installed. You can install pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Data Structures

The project covers the following pandas data structures:

- Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

## Data Manipulation

The notebook demonstrates various data manipulation techniques, including:

- Selecting data using loc and iloc
- Filtering data based on conditions
- Adding and dropping columns
- Grouping data and calculating aggregate statistics
- Handling missing data

## Advanced Operations

Advanced operations covered in the notebook include:

- Merging and concatenating DataFrames
- Applying custom functions to data
- Pivoting and reshaping data

## Examples

Here are some examples of operations performed in the notebook:

- Selecting data:

    ```sh
    print(df['Company'])  # Select one column
    print(df[['Company', 'Ticker Symbol']])  # Select multiple columns
    ```

- Grouping and aggregating data:

    ```sh
    grouped = df.groupby('Company').mean()
    print(grouped)
    ```

- Dropping a column:

    ```sh
    df = df.drop('OpenCloseDiff', axis=1)
    ```
